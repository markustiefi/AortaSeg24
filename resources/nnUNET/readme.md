Searching for nnUNet? Please go to this site: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet. We only used the framework with little adaptations for the AortaSeg24 challenge (https://aortaseg24.grand-challenge.org/) and have to publish the code. The skeleton recall loss is now implemented in the whole nnUNet framework (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/Skeleton-Recall). However, back when the challenge started the code we were not aware of the publicly availability of the code.
